# LeetCode (Golang)

This repository is for storing my LeetCode solutions; I was _going_ to do NeetCode
but it doesn't support solving in Go. My intent is to write all the solutions in
Go(lang), but that isn't a strict requirement. Solutions will be grouped by data
structure and sorted by problem number.
